# Problem 1

This dataset has 1,384,617 rows and 15 variables. This dataset is a
Tabular structure with each row representing an order and each column
representing an attribute. Key variables include order_id: identifier
for the order; aisle_id: identifier for the aisle; product_id:
identifier for the product; aisle: name of the aisle; product_name: name
of the product, etc.

``` r
# Number of aisles
num_aisles <- length(unique(instacart$aisle))
print(paste("Number of aisles:", num_aisles))
```

    ## [1] "Number of aisles: 134"

``` r
# Most items
aisle_order_counts <- table(instacart$aisle)
sorted_aisles <- names(sort(aisle_order_counts, decreasing = TRUE))
print("Most items are ordered from: Fresh Vegetable.")
```

    ## [1] "Most items are ordered from: Fresh Vegetable."

``` r
library(ggplot2)

filtered_aisles <- names(aisle_order_counts[aisle_order_counts > 10000])
filtered_data <- instacart[instacart$aisle %in% filtered_aisles,]
ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = reorder(aisle, -table(aisle)[aisle]), fill = aisle)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Aisle", y = "Number of Items Ordered", title = "Number of Items Ordered in Each Aisle (Aisles with > 10,000 items)")
```

Construct a dataset that is limited to `Excellent` responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the `data_value`
across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average
value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for
each state across years – the `geom_line` geometry and `group` aesthetic
will help).

``` r
excellent_responses <- brfss_smart2010_health |>
  filter(response == "Excellent")
average_data_value <- excellent_responses |>
  group_by(year, locationabbr) |>
  summarize(average_data_value = mean(data_value))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
ggplot(average_data_value, aes(x = year, y = average_data_value, group = locationabbr, color = locationabbr)) +
  geom_line() +
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Average Data Value", title = "Average Data Value Over Time within a State (Excellent Responses)")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 3 rows containing missing values (`geom_line()`).

Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State.
