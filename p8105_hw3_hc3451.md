# Problem 1

## Conclusion:

This dataset has 1,384,617 rows and 15 variables. This dataset is a
Tabular structure with each row representing an order and each column
representing an attribute. Key variables include order_id: identifier
for the order; aisle_id: identifier for the aisle; product_id:
identifier for the product; aisle: name of the aisle; product_name: name
of the product, etc.

``` r
# Number of aisles
num_aisles <- length(unique(instacart$aisle))
print(paste("Number of aisles:", num_aisles))
```

    ## [1] "Number of aisles: 134"

``` r
# Most items
aisle_order_counts <- table(instacart$aisle)
sorted_aisles <- names(sort(aisle_order_counts, decreasing = TRUE))
print("Most items are ordered from: Fresh Vegetable.")
```

Construct a dataset that is limited to `Excellent` responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the `data_value`
across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average
value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for
each state across years – the `geom_line` geometry and `group` aesthetic
will help).

``` r
excellent_responses <- brfss_smart2010_health |>
  filter(response == "Excellent")
average_data_value <- excellent_responses |>
  group_by(year, locationabbr) |>
  summarize(average_data_value = mean(data_value))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
ggplot(average_data_value, aes(x = year, y = average_data_value, group = locationabbr, color = locationabbr)) +
  geom_line() +
  guides(color = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Average Data Value", title = "Average Data Value Over Time within a State (Excellent Responses)")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 3 rows containing missing values (`geom_line()`).

![](p8105_hw3_hc3451_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

## Conclusion:

We can find that the average data value varies among the year as well as
different states.

Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State.

``` r
ny_data_2006_2010 <- brfss_smart2010_health |>
  filter(year %in% c(2006, 2010), locationabbr == "NY", response %in% c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent"))

ggplot(ny_data_2006_2010, aes(x = response, y = data_value, fill = response)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 2) +
  labs(x = "Response", y = "Data Value", 
       title = "Distribution of Data Value for NY State (2006 and 2010)") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](p8105_hw3_hc3451_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

## Conclusion:

We can observe a similar distribution in 2006 and 2010. The response
“good” has the highest average data value and the response “poor” has
the lowest average data value.

## Conclusion

After roughly 60 years old, the overall activity value decreases with
age approximately. Males are more active than females with less than a
high school degree. Females have greater activity than males at the high
school equivalent and higher education levels.

![](p8105_hw3_hc3451_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->

## Conclusion

The trends between gender are similar, indicating that there is no
significant difference for their activity between male and female. And
the trends in three educational levels are similar, indicating that
there is no significant difference for activity among educational
levels.
